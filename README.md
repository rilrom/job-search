# Job Search

Search for jobs from an external API.

## Project Status

This project is currently in development. Users can search by filters to find results from an external jobs listing API.
Eventual features include:
  - create my own API using Payload CMS to add, edit and delete job listings
  - authentication system so users can save specific jobs
  - time expiring caching system to speed up previously searched for results in a session

## Reflection

This project was to familiarize myself with @reduxjs/toolkit and various next.js functionality.

One of the main challenges was learning the new syntax for @reduxjs/toolkit. This required careful consideration of the developer documentation.
